# Numerod√≥n

This library help us to generate those numeric values from certain dates, words, or names.

## Releasing

For the initial release, it's better if you use:

```console
npm publish --access=public
```

And then remember to update the package settings inside NPM to require the 2FA.

To release a new version, we suggest using the `np` tool.

You can install that with the following:

```console
 npm install --global np
```

and release a new version by executing:

```console
np
```
